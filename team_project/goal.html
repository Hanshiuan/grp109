    <h1>Project Goals Accomplished</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>All 16 products were uploaded with full descriptions and clear images.</li>
      <li>Filtering by category is working smoothly and intuitively.</li>
      <li>Cart functionality is fully working, with add/remove features and real-time updates.</li>
      <li>Accessibility issues were fixed using Siteimprove — we resolved all AAA and A issues.</li>
      <li>HTML and CSS pass W3C validation and follow semantic best practices.</li>
      <li>The site is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.</li>
      <li>All team members contributed through design, descriptions, and JavaScript functionality.</li>
      <li>The design aesthetic is clean and aligned with our original brand vision.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      The only note we’d make is about the newsletter. While it’s fully functional — it shows the form, handles submissions, and gives a thank-you message — visually, it looks a little too basic compared to what we originally envisioned. With more time, we would’ve matched its style more closely to the rest of the site’s design aesthetic.
