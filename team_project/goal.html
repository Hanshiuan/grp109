    <ul>
      <li>All 16 products were uploaded with full descriptions and clear images.</li>
      <li>Filtering by category is working smoothly and intuitively.</li>
      <li>Cart functionality is fully working, with add/remove features and real-time updates.</li>
      <li>Accessibility issues were fixed using Siteimprove — we resolved all AAA and A issues.</li>
      <li>HTML and CSS pass W3C validation and follow semantic best practices.</li>
      <li>The site is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.</li>
      <li>All team members contributed through design, descriptions, and JavaScript functionality.</li>

      <p><strong>Original project ideas and what was accomplished</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Carousel for featuring sales/events, etc.</li>
        <li>Responsive navigation for different browser sizes</li>
        <li>✅ A top of the page banner for sales/alerts</li>
        <li>✅ Mock cart</li>
        <li>✅ Full product pages with description</li>
        <li>Include similar recommended items</li>
        <li>✅ Newsletter</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      The only note we’d make is about the newsletter. While it’s fully functional — it shows the form, handles
      submissions, and gives a thank-you message — visually, it looks a little too basic compared to what we originally
      envisioned. With more time, we would’ve matched its style more closely to the rest of the site’s design aesthetic.
