    <h1>Mumtaas</h1>

    <p>Hi! My name is Mumtaas. I’m currently studying software development with a focus on AI.</p>
    <p>I love front-end design and enjoy collaborating on interactive JavaScript features. I’m excited to help make our project more accessible and visually appealing.</p>
    <p>I’m in love with beautifully designed, aesthetically pleasing websites. I can spend hours just admiring them.</p>
    <p>Plants have always represented peace and tranquility to me. They feel like a glimpse of heaven on earth. When I lived in Kenya, I would see lush greenery in Uhuru Park and in the homes of the wealthy. I believed they had something special, something sacred. I thought plants were a privilege, something only a few people were allowed to experience.</p>
    <p>When I came to America, I assumed that privilege was universal. This was America, after all. Surely everyone would be surrounded by beauty. Surely everyone could experience a little piece of heaven. But I soon realized that no matter where you are, no matter how advanced a country may seem, there are always people living in two different worlds.</p>
    <p>I believe everyone deserves the chance to grow, to see, and to feel the joy that plants bring. That is why we fight to bring you, our beloved customers, the most beautiful and affordable plants possible, so that you can experience and enjoy what nature gifted you with, in the comfort of your home.</p>
