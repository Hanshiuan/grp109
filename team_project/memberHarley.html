    <h1>Harley</h1>

    <p>
      Hello! I’m Harley, a returning student at BC currently studying web
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background includes experience in the retail plant industry, where I
      eventually managed the webstore. That’s where I first fell in love with
      website design and became curious about how everything works behind the
      scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience ignited my passion for the web — from styling layouts to
      debugging code, I found joy in both the creative and technical sides of
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I’m expanding my skills at BC with hopes of either diving deeper
      into backend development or exploring the world of UX/UI design. I'm
      open to where this journey takes me — as long as I get to keep learning
      and building things that help others.
    </p>
