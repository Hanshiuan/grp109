    <h1>Harley</h1>

    <p>Hello! I’m Harley, a returning student at BC currently studying web development.</p>
    <p>My background includes experience in the retail plant industry, where I eventually managed the webstore. That’s where I first fell in love with website design and became curious about how everything works behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>This experience ignited my passion for the web — from styling layouts to debugging code, I found joy in both the creative and technical sides of development.</p>
    <p>Now, I’m expanding my skills at BC with hopes of either diving deeper into backend development or exploring the world of UX/UI design. I'm open to where this journey takes me — as long as I get to keep learning and building things that help others.</p>
