The delicate vine patterns are unique to each piece, making every planter a one-of-a-kind treasure. Though petite in size, its cultural richness and craftsmanship make it a bold statement in any space. Ethically made, culturally rooted, and ready to cradle your favorite plant with elegance.</p>
      <p><strong>Heritage Clay Vessel:</strong> Crafted using centuries-old ceramic techniques from rural Mexico, the Heritage Clay Vessel is a collector’s piece designed to honor the passage of time. Each vessel undergoes a natural aging process, creating the patina and texture of a well-worn heirloom. No two are alike. Perfect for styling dried arrangements or as a standalone work of earthy sophistication. This is not just pottery, it is preservation of ancestral artistry.</p>
      <p><strong>Harvest Hug Planter:</strong> The Harvest Hug Planter is a timeless staple with a comforting, rounded silhouette and sturdy built-in handles for easy carrying and rearranging.

      <h1 class="itemSection-header">Houseplants</h1>
      <p><strong>Monstera deliciosa:</strong> The Monstera Deliciosa is an eye-catching and easy-to-care-for plant. One of the most noticeable characteristics of the Monstera is its glossy heart-shaped leaves which split from the leaf edge to the center as the plant matures. The Monstera needs medium to bright light and it can adapt well under lower light conditions. Water your Philodendron Monstera well until the water drains from the bottom of the drip holes and allow the top of the soil to dry before watering again. Indoor house plants are proven to be excellent air purifiers that help decrease stress and anxiety while stimulating creativity and productivity. Great for yourself or as a gift.</p>
      <p><strong>Hoya lacunosa:</strong> Hoya lacunosa is named after its prominent characteristic of having "lacunose" leaves/surfaces (sunken between the veins). It is commonly referred to as the Cinnamon Hoya, for the light and spicy fragrance of cinnamon from its blooms. Hoya lacunosa is perfect for indoor cultivation year round, will grow in a variety of lighting conditions and flower readily even in lower levels of light. However, in bright conditions, with direct light for a couple of hours in the morning or late afternoon, the foliage can develop heavy silver mottling. It has a pendant growth habit that looks best in a hanging basket but can be trained to climb.</p>
      <p><strong>Philodendron brandiatum:</strong> The Philodendron Brandtianum, also known as the Silver Leaf Philodendron, has deep olive green heart-shaped leaves with prominent silver or iridescent gray patches. Another common name for this variety is Brandi Philodendron. As an epiphyte, a hemiepiphyte, and a terrestrial plant, Brandi can grow in most households. But growth rate and leaf color will vary greatly depending on soil type, sunlight, and temperature.</p>
      <p><strong>Aloe vera:</strong> There may be no live succulent plant as storied as aloe vera, revered through the ages for its health, beauty, medicinal and skin care uses. With its thick, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves, Aloe vera is a striking, tropical-style, drought-tolerant houseplant or garden plant that adds life to your home and garden décor. This succulent arrives fully rooted in a 2.50-QT container. When the weather warms up, you can place this versatile succulent on your patio or porch. If you dwell in a place where frost is not a concern, Aloe vera can live and thrive outside year-round. Thanks to its ability to store water, aloe vera can go longer between waterings than many other plants, especially traditional houseplants. Along with tolerating drought, this architecturally compelling succulent thrives with little care.</p>
      <p><strong>Rosemary:</strong> Rosemary is ever-green and is available fresh all year round. If you buy it in a pot, it will keep on a sunny windowsill (or outside in a sunny spot) for weeks, with regular watering. You could also plant bushes in your garden, alongside or instead of lavender, for a ready, fragrant supply of leaves. Rosemary's intense, fragrant aroma has traditionally been paired with lamb, chicken, and game, but it's also suited to fish and bean dishes.</p>

      <p><strong>Comfort grip hand trowel:</strong> The Corona Clipper comfort trowel features a lightweight one-piece aluminum alloy structure that won't bend, break, or rust.

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Planthaus has a sleek, modern, boutique feel — a trendy, minimalist, and creative approach.</p>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The website will offer mock products, purchases, a front page carousel, plant care page, profile, cart, and more.</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>We will start with barebones features, adding more with JS and other functions. Example: Product pages + cart (no add/remove yet).</p>
    </section>

    <script src="js/inputHandler.js"></script>
    <script>
      const categoryButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.category-button');
      const sections = document.querySelectorAll('.itemSection');

      categoryButtons.forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          const category = button.getAttribute('data-category');

          sections.forEach(section => {
            const sectionCategory = section.getAttribute('data-category');
            if (category === 'all' || sectionCategory === category) {
              section.style.display = 'block';
