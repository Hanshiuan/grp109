      <strong>About this product:</strong>
      <p>  Hoya lacunosa is named after its prominent characteristic of having "lacunose" leaves/surfaces (sunken between the veins). It is commonly referred to as the Cinnamon Hoya, 
              for the light and spicy fragrance of cinnamon from its blooms. Hoya lacunosa is perfect for indoor cultivation year round, will grow in a variety of lighting conditions and flower 
              readily even in lower levels of light. However, in bright conditions, with direct light for a couple of hours in the morning or late afternoon, the foliage can develop heavy silver mottling. 
              It has a pendant growth habit that looks best in a hanging basket but can be trained to climb.
